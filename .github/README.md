# My .files

In case you didn't know, "dotfiles" are configuration files on Unix-like
operating systems like Linux. Because they start with a `.`, so they don't show
up in you file manager etc, they are often refered to as "dotfiles".

I love customizing everything I use. That's why I accumulated a lot of config
files for all kinds of programs over the time. They are now in this repository.

## Why "infinity"?

Initially, I had a rather complex system which was generating my dotfiles
according to a uniform colorscheme, settings for different machines etc. Also I
had an additional repository for my scripts, however they should have belonged
together with the dotfiles - you are starting to see what kind of mess it was.
That's why I started working on a clean new way to customize my desktop. The
name comes from an idea I had for some time to build an own desktop environment -
the name for it would've been "infinity"; it was also the name of a website I
maintaned for some time with the docs for all of the projects that go into my
desktop setup.

## Licensing

The configs are written by me after studying the according documentation for the
most part and published under the GNU GPLv3 (see `LICENSE`). However, some parts
are copied from other sources, so different licensing terms may apply to them.
For foreign code, you can always find the source I got it from in the comments.

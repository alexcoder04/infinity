# The Z SHell

I have used zsh for a while already, in my opinion, it is the best interactive
shell. My config has a bunch of features (some may say too much), but I actually
need most of them all the time.

## Essential features

 - syntax highlighting
 - fish-like abbreviation expansion
 - different cursors/prompts for insert and vim modes
 - bookmarks
 - vim navigation in menuselect
 - custom minimal prompt
 - machine-specific settings at startup
 - various aliases (shorter git commands, interactive rm, ...)

# NeoVim

Neovim is my text editor of choice nowadays. I try to use as few plugins as
possible and write myself as much as possible instead. That's why it behaves a
little weird sometimes...

I also use [nvimpager](https://github.com/lucc/nvimpager) as my pager as well
as a syntax-highlighting cat replacement.

## Some of the key features

 - custom statusline
 - custom colorscheme which loads its colors from environmental variables
 - custom bindings for navigating tabs and splits
 - building previews for MD files (handled by extra script)
 - snippets for HTML, MD, LaTeX and Python
 - Coc plugin for autocompletion
